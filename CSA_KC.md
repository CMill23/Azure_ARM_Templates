# CSA Knowledge Center


## What is it about?

*"Do we have a demo for Azure service **X** / Use Case **Y**"*

*"Uhm, I think I once saw some resources/content for that - But Im not sure where"*

Like this or similar a CSA might have come across in their daily doings - The tool & demo landscape within Microsoft is vast and mostly intransparent and its quite time consuming to browse through all the pre-existing resources. Thats something we`d like to tackle with the CSA Knowledge Center.

The goal of it is to provide a **One-Stop-Shop experience** with pre-existing Tools/Demos/Content for technical ramp-ups / hands-on experience and implementing Azure demo environments for upcoming customer presentations / workhops. Basically a handy glossary to browse through if you are searching for any particular use case / setup you`d like to deploy & educate yourself on.

The Knowledge Centere site is section is X Topics:

1. **Build it yourself:** Nowadays, the enterprise standard for cloud implementations is surrounded by Infrastructure-as-a-Code (IaaC) and its a handy way of implementing cloud environments in a clean, versioned and reusable manner. In this section you`ll find pre-existing modular IaaC repositories (e.g. ARM, Biceps or Terraform) to implement your own demo environment. If you are new to IaaC world, we got you, first introductional material you will find as well.
2. **Workshop:** Pre-existing Demo-Enviornment
